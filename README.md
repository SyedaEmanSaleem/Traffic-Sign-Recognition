# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Recognition

## **Overview**

Traffic Sign Recognition using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** on the **GTSRB dataset**.
The project classifies German traffic signs in images, evaluates model performance, and visualizes predictions with images and video.

---

## **Features**

* Preprocessing: resizing, normalization, one-hot encoding
* CNN model with **3 convolutional blocks**, Batch Normalization, and Dropout
* Callbacks: **EarlyStopping**, **ModelCheckpoint**, **ReduceLROnPlateau**
* Evaluation: accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, classification report
* Visualization: training curves, random/misclassified test images
* Video demonstration of predictions
* Class ID mapping to human-readable traffic sign names

---

## **Dataset**

* **GTSRB â€“ German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark**
* 43 traffic sign classes
* Train and Test folders with CSV files for labels

---

## **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-recognition.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Main packages: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, KaggleHub)*

## **Usage**

1. Open the Colab notebook.
2. Run cells sequentially:

   * Import libraries
   * Set dataset paths
   * Load and preprocess data
   * Build and compile CNN model
   * Train with callbacks
   * Evaluate with accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix
   * Visualize predictions and generate a video

---

## **Training Results**

* **Training Accuracy:** 99.37%
* **Validation Accuracy:** 98.08%
* **Best model saved at:** Epoch 13 (`best_model.h5`)
* **Early stopping** triggered at Epoch 18
* **ReduceLROnPlateau** successfully lowered learning rate when validation plateaued

---

## **Visualizations**

* Training & validation accuracy/loss plots
* Confusion matrix of predictions
* Random and misclassified test image visualizations
* Video animation of model predictions

---

## **Model Architecture**

* **Input:** 30x30x3 images
* **Conv layers:** 32 â†’ 64 â†’ 128 filters + ReLU + MaxPooling
* **Dense layers:** 256 neurons + Dropout
* **Output layer:** 43 classes, Softmax activation

---

## **Future Improvements**

* Apply **transfer learning** (ResNet, MobileNet) for better accuracy
* Real-time traffic sign recognition via **webcam or video stream**
* Deploy as a **web app** with Streamlit/Gradio or **mobile app** using TensorFlow Lite
* Use **Grad-CAM** for model interpretability
